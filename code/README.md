# Overview
Salty.IO is a Decentralized Exchange on Ethereum which uses Automatic Atomic Arbitrage (AAA) to generate yield and provide Zero Fees on all swaps.

With AAA, market inefficiencies are arbitraged at swap time to create profits - which are then distributed to liquidity providers and stakers and used to form Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) for the DAO.

Additionally, Salty.IO provides USDS, an overcollateralized ERC20 stablecoin native to the protocol which uses WBTC/WETH LP as collateral.

The exchange is 100% decentralized at launch - with all parameters, regional exclusions, whitelisting, and contracts controlled by the DAO itself.

Futher details about the project can be found at https://docs.salty.io

# Technical Overview
The Salty.IO codebase is divided up into the following folders:

**/arbitrage** - handles searching for arbitrage opportunities at user swap time -  with the actual arbitrage swaps being done within Pools.sol itself.

**/dao** - handles creating governance proposals, voting, acting on successful proposals and managing POL (Protocol Owned Liquidity). DAO adjustable parameters are stored in ~Config.sol contracts and are stored on a per folder basis.

**/launch** - handles the initial airdrop, initial distribution, and bootstrapping ballot (a decentralized vote by the airdrop recipients to start up the DEX and distribute SALT).

**/pools** - a core part of the exchange which handles liquidity pools, swaps, arbitrage, and user token deposits (which reduces gas costs for multiple trades) and pools contribution to recent arbitrage trades (for proportional rewards distribution).

**/price_feed** - implements a redundant price aggregator (initially using Chainlink, Uniswap v3 TWAP and the Salty.IO reserves) to provide the BTC and ETH prices used by the overcollateralized stablecoin framework.

**/rewards** - handles global SALT emissions, SALT rewards (which are sent to liquidity providers and stakers), and includes a rewards emitter mechanism (which emits a percentage of rewards over time to reduce rewards volatility).

**/stable** - includes the USDS contract and collateral functionality which allows users to deposit WBTC/WETH LP as collateral, borrow USDS (which mints it when borrowed), repay USDS (which burns it) and allow users to liquidate undercollateralized positions.

**/staking** - implements a staking rewards mechanism which handles users receiving rewards proportional to some "userShare".  What the userShare actually represents is dependent on the contract that derives from StakingRewards.sol (namely Staking.sol which handles users staking SALT, and CollateralAndLiquidity.sol which handles users depositing collateral and liquidity).

**/** - includes the SALT token, the default AccessManager (which allows for DAO controlled geo-restriction) and the Upkeep contract (which contains a user callable performUpkeep() function that ensures proper functionality of ecosystem rewards, emissions, POL formation, etc).

_Note for C4 wardens: Anything included in this `Automated Findings / Publicly Known Issues` section is considered a publicly known issue and is ineligible for awards._

* Any issue from the ABDK audit labeled as "Info" will be considered ineligible.
* Fee on transfer tokens are not supported on the exchange.
* The mechanism by which ownership is relinquished after just one call is deliberate.
* Our choice not to validate contract addresses using methods like `isContract` was deliberate.
* Custom error messages have been intentionally excluded, regardless of their potential gas savings.
* The length of our revert strings is by design, and we are not interested in gas reductions that could be achieved by shortening them.
* The absence of checks for the zero address ('0x0') in the code is an intentional gas-saving measure.
* The level of logic inlining present in the code is as intended, and there is no interest in pursuing additional inlining for runtime gas savings.
* Our abstraction of logic is at the desired level, and we are not looking to decrease bytecode size further to save on deployment gas costs.
* We have consciously chosen readability over minor gas savings that might be achieved by using Yul.
* Broadly, code alterations for minor gas optimizations that yield savings of less than 100 gas per operation are not under consideration.

# Additional Context
* Bisection search used to optimize arbitrage in ArbitrageSearch.sol
* Algebra used in PoolMath.sol to perform liquidity zapping.
* Initial tokens whitelisted on the exchange will be WBTC, WETH and DAI as well as the native USDS and SALT tokens.
* Salty.IO will be deployed on Ethereum mainnet.
* The only trusted role is the DAO.  There is no other ownership or priviledged role as the exchange is decentralized at launch.
* DOS exceeding 15 minutes would be valid.

# Attack ideas (Where to look for bugs)
* Areas related to the incorrect loss or theft of tokens held by any account.
* Any issue that would prevent the accurate reporting of BTC and ETH price from the PriceAggregator.
* Issues that would prevent the correct functioning of rewards distribution.
* Any issue that would prevent the DAO from functioning correctly.
* Any issue related to the USDS stablecoin, collateral and the liquidation process.
* Precision issues which could result in transactions failing or the DEX entering an undesirable state.
* Issues with performUpkeep in UpKeep.sol that would cause it to fail or enter an undesirable state.
